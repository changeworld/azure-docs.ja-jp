      How is Resource Health different from Azure status or the Service Health dashboard?
    answer: >
      The information provided by Resource Health is more specific than what is provided by Azure status or the Service Health dashboard.


      Whereas [Azure status](https://status.azure.com) and the Service Health dashboard inform you about service issues that affect a broad set of customers (for example an Azure region), Resource Health exposes more granular events that are relevant only to the specific resource. For example, if a host unexpectedly reboots, Resource Health alerts only those customers whose virtual machines were running on that host.

    answer: >
      No.  Azure Resource Health is accessible within the Azure portal without any setup requirements.
  - question: >
      Is Resource Health available free of charge?
    answer: >
      Yes.  Azure Resource Health is free of charge.
  - question: >
      What are the recommendations that Resource Health provides?
    answer: "Based on the health status, Resource Health provides you with recommendations with the goal of reducing the time you spent troubleshooting. For available resources, the recommendations focus on how to solve the most common problems customers encounter. If the resource is unavailable due to an Azure unplanned event, the focus will be on assisting you during and after the recovery process. \n"
